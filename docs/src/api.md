!!! warning "Stability"
    The entries written on this page are automatically generated and DO NOT represent
    the currently supported API surface. Supposition.jl is currently in a 0.x release;
    feel free to use anything you can find here, but know that (for now) only
    symbols that are exported are expected to stick around (they too may change, but I
    don't expect the underlying functionality to vanish entirely).
